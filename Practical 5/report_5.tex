\section{Protocol Design}
This Longest Paths Practical Work is written in C++, using our previously made Mapper and Reducer.

\section{Codes}
\subsection{Map}
How this section works is that, we detect each path by a "BACKSLASH" (a back slash but in C++, it's required to type BACKSLASH twice, doesn't work in here either so i have to write BACKSLASH) and it's stored in a pair of string and int.\\
This is the code snippet from the mapping section of the practical work: \\

\subsection{Reduce}
This reduce section is mainly working with vector in C++, we have 2 vectors, 1 is the first vector and the other is the result. In the previous mapping section, every time a path is "mapped", the first vector also got pushed with a "SKIP" string. We look for each word separated by a back slash until we find a "SKIP" string and we push that full sentence into the result vector. \\
Then finally, in the result vector, find the sentence with the largest Int. \\
This is the code snippet from the reduce section of the practical work: \\

\subsection{Result}
The sentence can be changed in the codes, we haven't tested if it works with Uppercase and Lowercase yet, but 1 think to note is that at the end of the sentence, it needs a "BACKSLASH" black slash or the program won't recognize the final word.\\

\textbf{In conclusion:}\\
The program is running smoothly and it's working as intended. The program is to our satisfaction!!
